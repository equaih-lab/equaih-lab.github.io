## About Me

I’m Dr. Gloria Hyunjung Kwak, an Assistant Professor at Emory University’s Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing/ Centre for Data Science/ Emory AI Health. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a strong background in AI, my research focuses on developing equitable AI solutions that address healthcare disparities and social determinants of health.

## My Mission

My mission is to integrate AI ethically into healthcare, ensuring that technology serves all populations fairly. I’m passionate about creating AI-driven solutions that are not only innovative but also considerate of the social contexts affecting patient care.

## What I Care About

I care deeply about fairness in AI, particularly in how biases can affect clinical outcomes. My work aims to bridge gaps between technology and healthcare, promoting ethical standards that improve patient care globally.

## Fun Fact

I truly love my research. Beyond my research, I enjoy exploring art galleries, drawing inspiration from classic painters to keep my creative side alive, and trying new dishes and hobbies. I love paddle boarding, kayaking, and sailing—though I’m not the best swimmer!

_"Live the moment and fill every second with what you love."_

I find joy in nature's little moments: the sparkle of sunshine, the earthy scent of rain on grass, and the magic of winter snow with glistening snowflakes and the crisp, frosty air. I love the cozy warmth of mulled wine in winter, savoring each season for its unique charm.
