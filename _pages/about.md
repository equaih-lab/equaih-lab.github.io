# Welcome to Kwakâ€™s Lab
Advancing Equitable AI Solutions for Inclusive Healthcare

## About the Lab
Led by Dr. Hyunjung Gloria Kwak, our group focuses on advancing machine learning and AI to promote fairness in healthcare. Our goals are:

- Clinical Impact: Develop practical algorithms that address real clinical challenges.
- Machine Learning: Ensure rigorous, safe AI solutions for high-stakes environments like healthcare.
- Fairness: Design solutions that are equitable for all patients, not just a select few.

We aim to bridge technology and healthcare with integrity and inclusivity.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
